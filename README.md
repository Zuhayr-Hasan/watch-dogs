<!-- Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Zuhayr Hasan.

I have developed a visually stunning application utilizing Tailwind CSS and React. The application features a robust authentication system, including email verification, and is fully responsive across all devices.

I employed ApexCharts for the implementation of intricate pie charts and scatter plots, enhancing the analytical capabilities of the app.

Additionally, I crafted a custom table that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various platforms and screen sizes. -->

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
